= JS-RULES

The R2D2 product stack is composed of multiple NodeJS micro-services.
They need to be written with the same rules, and it's a lot of time spent maintaining every config file on all repositories.

== How ?

To do so we are using three tools:

____
What is {prettier-link}[Prettier]?
An opinionated code formatter
____

This tool is responsible for the code format: comma, semicolon, width, that's for `Prettier`.

____
{eslint-link}[Eslint]
Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code
____

A useless variable?
`var`, `const` or `let`?
All these conventions are settled by the `eslint` configuration.

____
{husky-link}[Husky] can prevent a bad git commit, git push and more üê∂ woof!
____

This tool allows us to easily share git hooks.
We are using it with the previous ones to keep our code base safe from linting errors.

=== On save

==== Prettier

When you save your file, you can ask your IDE to format your code for you.
It will follow the rules described in the `.prettier.js` config file.

In order to make it work you may need some plugins:

* https://github.com/madskristensen/JavaScriptPrettier[VSCode]
* https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier[Vim]
* You can find an IDE plugins list on {prettier-link}[Prettier]

==== Eslint

The exact same thing goes for eslint.
You can ask your IDE to follow the rules specified in the https://github.com/r2d2bzh/eslint-config[`eslint-config`] repository.

In order to make it work you may again need some plugins:

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint[VSCode]
* You can find an IDE plugins list on https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations[eslint documentation]

NOTE: These are not mandatory but strongly recommended.

=== On commit

When you commit your code modifications, Husky ensures that the following git hook is run:

[source,javascript]
----
include::./index.js[tag=pre-commit,indent=0]
----

Before committing `husky` calls `prettier` to format your code in case your IDE missed it.
Then it will ask `eslint` to lint and fix your code.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If an error is found during the validation the commit is canceled.
You will have to first fix the lint errors before trying to commit again.
====

=== On push

There is currently no action on push but you can add some hooks yourself if you want.

You can add a `pre-push` action that will verify that the unit tests succeed, for instance:

.huskyrc.js
[source,js]
----
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    ...require('js-rules')('husky')({
      "pre-push": "docker-compose exec -T dev npm test"
    }),
  },
};
----

== Install

You need to add the following NPM development dependency to the project that needs to be checked:

`npm install --save-dev @r2d2bzh/eslint-config`

This will add the package `js-rules` to the dependencies of your repository.

`js-rules` pulls the following dependencies so you don't have to do it yourself:

package.json
[source,js]
----
include::./package.json[lines=9..24]
----
